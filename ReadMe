For future uses, in this file "busreserb" holds the project developed by Dasigan, G.A., Objero, L., Pineda, C.A., and Suzuki, H. 

Project Overview:
This Pasaheroes: Bus Ticket Reservation provides an online ticket booking reservation site which will allow the people to reserve bus tickets when they wish to travel. The bus will only be point-to-point, meaning, the bus will travel directly to a desired destination. The booking will be done online, to avoid the risk of the passengers of going out just to get tickets. In addition, this will lessen the hassle of finding transportation vehicle when travelling since the site can be accessed anytime and anywhere.
